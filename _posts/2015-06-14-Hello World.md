My name is Jibril,
This is my personal website, i don't know why you visited this website, you're probably just one of my friend who knows this website of mine.

I'm Indonesian,
But i write this website in English, so people around the world can understand what this website really is. There will probably a grammar error well... because my grammar sucks, don't judge.

I'm a High school student,
For now though. I'm a student at SMAN 91. So i will possibly upload my school stuff here.

I do stuff,
I do Graphic design on Photoshop, and a little bit of Java programming(still learning).

This website
is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I used to use Blogger to run my website but it's just overrated and have a very limited editing, i tried WordPress but deleted it after 5min later after i found out that i have to pay MONTHLY to map my domain(excluding the domain itself).. screw that :unamused:. One day i thought about this thing called Jekyll that i found out when i was surfing on the Internet, so i came across this website and i thought it was pretty fancy and simple so i'm pretty interested and do a research about it for awhile. Then i decided to use it. It is somehow complicated to install and manage but when you finally understand it's actually pretty easy and fun(because using a command line to manage a website is fun!). Check out the website if you're interested i'm not going to explain it here. I used [Contrast](http://niklasbuschmann.github.io/contrast) as my theme and have a little bit of modificaiton(because i want a costumised website and not just a copy pasted looking website).

Good,
Now you know who i am. You could go now or perhaps you wanna stay a little while? it's up to you though.

Have a good one :)
